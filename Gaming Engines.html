    <h1 class="one">The Best Gaming Engines You Should Consider</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Each page is going to give you a little backround information about specific Gaming engines and will dive deeper into details of each one, but you might be thinking, What is a gaming engine anyway? well, A game engine is a software program or environment that provides devs with the tools and APIs needed to create video games, graphics, and visualizations. This includes everything from AI and animation to physics simulation and audio.Game engines provide the framework for all things video game creation — giving devs the freedom to focus their attention on game content, rather than the more detailed tech bits.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div>

    <div>
        <h1 class="one">R.E engine</h1>
        <p>RE Engine is a gaming engine developed by Capcom. The successor of MT Framework, it was initially built for Resident Evil 7: Biohazard and has since appeared in several Capcom games.

            Contray to popular belief that the letters "RE" stands for "Resident Evil", they are actually the first two letters of the engine's full name, "Reach for the moon", which the logo appropriately shows.[1]
            
            compatible with most systems and is completely free to use.</p>

        <p>While you’ll be getting an in-depth review of the top gaming engines in our analasy in the next few pages, it’s important to make sure your selected solution is indeed allowing you to tackle multiple issues in one place. Your average game engine should be able to provide you with ways to simplify critical tasks such as:

            Physics – In-game immersions/physics should be a perfect balance between simulation quality and computing power limitations for the end-user.
            Input – This is an extremely common issue in cross-platform development. Is your gaming engine solving this problem for you?
            Visual Assets Processing – Lighting, shading, texture-mapping, and depth-of-field require less programming effort while using game engines.
            In a nutshell, your chosen gaming engine should give you the ability to perform the aforementioned tasks with reduced coding efforts. This helps shorten development times significantly and allows teams to focus on designing their games to deliver a unique and special user experience.</p>
