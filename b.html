  <p>RE Engine was created in 2014, during the beginning of the development of Resident Evil 7. The engine was originally designed with the game's linear nature in mind and was created to make game development more efficient. The reason the team did not choose a third-party engine was that "a highly generic engine developed by another company would not be appropriate" for a game like Resident Evil 7.MT Framework was not used for the project due to its slower development tools. Jun Takeuchi, the head of Capcom's Division 1 stated "we had to rethink the way we make games. In order to carry out asset-based (graphic and 3D model elements) development, which is globally the mainstream, we began developing our new RE Engine".</p></div>

  <h1> Features</h1>
  <div class="para3">
  <p>RE Engine features various improvements over MT Framework, including new anti-aliasing and volumetric lighting features. The engine also allows developers to use photogrammetry to create higher quality assets. It also includes improved VR support over its predecessor, allowing it to hit high framerates necessary to avoid motion sickness. It also includes tools to make animation faster, such as modular rigging, motion matching, procedural animation and motion retargeting.  RE Engine also has various new physics simulation options which allow for more realistic debris.</p>
